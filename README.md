# VisionHandPose-iOS-swift

In the innovative app I developed, users can engage in a unique interactive experience by swiping images using live camera gestures. A thumbs-up in front of the camera initiates a Tinder-like swipe towards the 'like' direction, while a thumbs-down gesture smoothly moves the image towards 'dislike.' What makes it even more captivating is that users are simultaneously captured on the live camera as they express their preferences.
